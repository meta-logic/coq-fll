# First-Order Focused Linear Logic in Coq

We formalize in Coq a focused system [2] for first-order linear logic (FLL)
[1]. We prove cut-elimination directly in this system using five cut-rules
dealing with the two different kind of sequents in this system (focused and
unfocused sequents). 

Following [3], we encode the inference rules of other logics as LL theories and
formalize the necessary conditions for those logics to have the cut-elimination
property. We then obtain cut-elimination for first-order classical, minimal and
intuitionistic logics. We also use the LL meta-theory to formalize the relative
completeness of natural deduction and sequent calculus in first-order minimal
logic. 

We have also formalized the result in [5]: Hybrid Linear Logic can be
adequately encoded as an LL theory. Moreover, we propose an alternative
encoding which is cut-coherent and we obtain cut-elimination for HyLL.

## Getting Started

The project was tested in Coq 8.12.0 No extra library is needed for compilation. 

### Building 

Typing "make" should suffice to compile the project (time ~7min):

```
make
```

The project documentation can be generated by

```
make html
```


## Structure of the project / proofs

We briefly describe the content (theorems and definitions) of the .v files. The
documentation of the library offers more detailed explanations. 

We use the Hybrid library [4]  to support reasoning about object logics (OLs)
expressed using higher-order abstract syntax (HOAS). Hybrid is implemented as a
two-level system and then, we have:

 - Focused first-order linear logic as  specification logic (SL); and
 - Different OLs encoded as LL theories. 

For this reason, the project is divided in two main subdirectories, namely,  SL
and OL plus an additional one (Misc) for some miscellaneous definitions and
results. 


### Misc
In Hybrid.v there is an adaptation of the Hybrid library for our purposes.
There are also additional results about lists and permutations needed in the
development. The results in Permutation.v are based on the ones in
[MyPermutations.v](<a href="https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/certicoq/blob/master/libraries/MyPermutations.v"). 

### SL
This directory contains the formalization of the specification logic (i.e.,
focused first-order linear logic) and the cut-elimination theorem. 

#### SL/Syntax
This file defines the syntax of linear logic and its notation.  We also define
several notions needed for the focused system (e.g., negative and positive
formulas, polarity of atoms, etc)


#### LL/Sequent
This file formalizes Andreoli's triadic (focused) system for linear logic.
Sequents are of the shape 

```
|-- B ; M ; X
```

where

 - B is the classical context
 - M contains only positive formulas
 - X is an "arrow" that can be:
  - UP L, where L is a list of formulas (negative phase )
  - DW F, where F is a formula (positive phase)



#### SL/StructuralRules
We prove that,  multiset-equivalent contexts (i.e., lists up to permutation)
prove the same theorems (exchange rule). We also prove that the classical
context admits the usual weakening and contraction rules (preserving the height
of the derivation). 

#### SL/FLLTactics
Here we define several tactics useful for dealing with FLL sequents. 

#### SL/InvNegativePhase
This file proves some invertibility lemmas for the negative (unfocus) phase. In
the end, `EquivUpArrow` shows that exchange is admissible in the list
`L` of the negative phase. 

#### SL/InvPositivePhase
This file proves some invertibility lemmas showing that positive rules
can be switched.

#### SL/CutElimination
The proof of the cut-elimination theorem for the focused system.


#### SL/IdElimination
The general initial rule is admissible. 



### Object Logics
This directory contains a simple example showing how to use the library to
prove sequents in FLL. It also contains two applications of the framework: 
 1. Formalizing the necessary conditions for an object logic to have the
    cut-elimination property following the approach in [3]. 
 2. Encoding a transition system and proving some properties of it. 

The README.md file in each directory contains further details on the formalized
theorems.
